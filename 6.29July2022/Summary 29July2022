Javascript
	This is web development language which is used to create dynamism in html pages.Any dynamic behaviour in html page is done with the help of javascript.

	Three ways to declare javascript variable:
		var, let, cosnt

	We can run javascript in two ways
		using node : By using node and running javascript through cmd.
		using html : By embedding the javascript code in html code.

	using javascript using html:
		Script tag is used to embed the code in the html body

	To show output of javascript :
		console.log(//The statement you want to print);  //This command is usedto maintian log files and it outputs the output in console of the browser

		documnet.getElementById("Idname").innerHTML="Total is: " + totp;
		This line outputs the output on the window

	Question : if i use idname of the object before declaring the object will it help me show the output of the javascript code?
		If you call any object before declaration then nothing will happen. To return javascript output you have to first create an object and then call it 
		if we are not following this then it will not work.

	object in javac=script is the value that stores multiple key valkue pairs.
	Syntax:
		let person={fname:"Aaditya", lname:"Duggal",age:21,ecolor : "Black"};
